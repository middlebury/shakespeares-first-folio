                        <p>These famous plays and 15 others by Shakespeare would probably have been lost to us without the First Folio. Published in 1623, it’s the first collected edition of Shakespeare’s plays, and only 233 copies are known today. To mark the 400th anniversary of Shakespeare’s death, the Folger Shakespeare Library is sending a First Folio to every U.S. state, and we are the hosts for Vermont.</p>

                    <p>Shakespeare has been a prism through which American issues—revolution, slavery, war, social justice—have been refracted. Drawing upon his recent anthology of writings, Columbia University professor James Shapiro explores how the history of Shakespeare in America is also the history of America itself.</p>
                    <p>James Shapiro, Professor of English and Comparative Literature at Columbia University, is the author of 1599: A Year in the Life of William Shakespeare; Contested Will, Shakespeare in America; and The Year of Lear: Shakespeare in 1606.</p>
